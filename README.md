# Arduino_RPClite

A MessagePack RPC library for Arduino allows to create a client/server architecture using MessagePack as the serialization format. It follows the [MessagePack-RPC protocol specification](https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md). It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, making it suitable for embedded systems and IoT applications.
